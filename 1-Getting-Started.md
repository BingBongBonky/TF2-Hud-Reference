# Getting Started

## custom folder

To begin with, every hud must have a folder in custom. This takes the form of:
```
steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\HudName\
```
HudName can be any name of the hud. Inside of this hud will be various files and folders, taking the directory structure like so:
```
custom\HudName\info.vdf
custom\HudName\materials\
custom\HudName\resource\
custom\HudName\scripts\
```
