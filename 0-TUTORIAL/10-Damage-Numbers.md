# Damage Numbers

Huddamageaccount.res is the file that controls the damage numbers that appear when you damage players. It is located:
```
resource/ui/huddamageaccount.res
```

## Damage Account

The default file only includes one element, the damage account panel, which controls floating damage numbers:
```
	"CDamageAccountPanel"
	{
		"fieldName"				"CDamageAccountPanel"
		"text_x"				"0"
		"text_y"				"0"
		"delta_item_end_y"		"0"
		"PositiveColor"			"0 255 0 255"
		"NegativeColor"			"255 0 0 255"
		"delta_lifetime"		"1.5"
		"delta_item_font"		"HudFontSmall"
		"delta_item_font_big"	"HudFontMedium"
	}
```
