# Tools

There are many tools and programs that are useful for working with hud files.

## Text editors

For the most part, you can use any text editor you want, as long as it's not notepad.

Here are some commonly recommended alternatives that are good for working with hud files:
* Notepad++: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
* VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
* Atom: https://atom.io/
* Sublime: https://www.sublimetext.com/

## Vpk files

Vpk files are the file format that all tf2 files are stored with. They can be opened with GCFScape. It can be downloaded here:

## Image editors

There are two options for working with vtf files.

The easier option is to use the vtf plugins for popular editors. Here they are:
* Paint.net: http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=50
* Photoshop: http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?c=154

The longer, but more flexible approach is to use VTFEdit to convert into and out of the vtf format. It can be downloaded here:

## Font editors

Very few hud editors will edit their own fonts. But it can be a valuable skill and there are some creative techniques that require custom fonts.

Because fonts will be either ttf or otf files, which are completely standard formats, you can use your choice of font editing software. Some good free options are:
* fontforge: https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/
* birdfont: https://birdfont.org/
