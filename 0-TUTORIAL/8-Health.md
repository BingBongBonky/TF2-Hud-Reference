# Health

Hudplayerhealth.res is the file that controls your health on the hud. It's the most prominent example of a hud file that doesn't use hudlayout.res, and its parent panel is positioned and resized from within hudplayerhealth.res itself. It can be found in:
```
resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res
```
