# Refract Materials

Refracts are a type of material that can be used in a few ways for unique purposes.

## Understanding Refracts

To begin with, it's important to understand what a refract is and why it works the way it does. In a general sense, a refract is a material that can warp the view world geometry, depending on its strength and the uv material used. For example, this is used in tf2 for underwater effects or when jarate'd, to distort your view of the world.

In huds, the strength will almost always be 0. This means that there is no warping, and now you have a material that is (mostly) identical to your view of the map. Beyond this it's a regular material, and can still be affected by many vmt properties or proxies.
