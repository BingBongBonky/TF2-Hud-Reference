# Tools

There are many tools and programs that are useful for working with hud files.

## Text editors

For the most part, you can use any text editor you want, as long as it's not notepad.

Here are some commonly recommended alternatives that are good for working with hud files:
* Notepad++: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

## Image editors

There are two options for working with vtf files.

The easier option is to use the vtf plugins for popular editors. Here they are:
* Paint.net: http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=50
* Photoshop: http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?c=154

The longer, but more flexible approach is to use VTFEdit to convert into and out of the vtf format. It can be download here:
