# Captions

Captions are short messages that play when certain sounds happen ingame.

There are a few parts involved in captions. Captions are enabled with a console command:

```
closecaption 1
```

And then can be further customized with other commands:

```
cc_subtitles 0 // if set to 1, don't show sfx-marked captions
cc_lang english // which caption file to use
cc_linger_time 1.0 // how long captions should be visible for
cc_predisplay_time 0.25 // how long to wait before showing a caption
cc_sentencecaptionnorepeat 4 // how long for a caption to not repeat
```
